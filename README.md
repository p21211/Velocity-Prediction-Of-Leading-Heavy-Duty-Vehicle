The research intends to show the potential of reinforcement learning approaches to en-
hance the efficiency and safety of surface goods transportation. The Vehicle may modify ts speed to maintain a proper separation by accurately assessing the speed of a leading heavy-duty vehicle. As a result, fuel efficiency is improved, and CO2 emissions are decreased. Traditional methods usually rely on communication between vehicles to determine the speed profile of the leading vehicle. Not all vehicles are equipped with this kind of communication capability.
